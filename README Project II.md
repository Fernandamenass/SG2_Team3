# Project II: Production Dashboard Integration

## Authors: Eduardo Martinez, Fernanda Mena, Brandon Avalos.

This project extends a discrete-event simulation system by integrating it with a dynamic web-based dashboard. The goal is to visualize key production metrics generated from simulation runs, facilitating a better understanding of factory performance in real-time-like environments.

---

## Project Overview

The system consists of two separate Git repositories:

### 1. `SG2_Team3`
This repository contains the simulation and data generation code.
- `plotting.py`: Main script that runs 100 simulations, aggregates results, and exports them as a structured JSON file.

### 2. `SG2_Tean3_MidTermII`
This repository contains the interactive dashboard for visualizing simulation outputs.
- `index.html`: Central dashboard file to visualize production statistics.
- `data/`: Folder that receives the JSON file generated by `plotting.py`.

---

## Key Features

### Simulation Features
- **Six Workstations**: Simulate sequential operations with failure events, bottlenecks, and maintenance.
- **Accident & Rejection Modeling**: Simulates accidents (1%) and product rejections (5%) for realistic production insights.
- **Statistical Metrics**:
  - Production output
  - Rejection rate
  - Supplier occupancy
  - Workstation delays, fixing time, bottlenecks, and downtime

### Dashboard Visualization
- Multiple views: Daily, Weekly, Monthly, etc.
- Interactive metrics:
  - Rechazo (% rejection)
  - Ocupación (occupancy)
  - Retrasos (delays)
  - Accidentes (accidents)
- Pie and bar charts generated using D3.js or similar libraries.

## File Structure

```bash
project/
├── SG2_Team3/
│   └── plotting.py              # Simulation runner and JSON generator
└── SG2_Tean3_MidTermII/
    ├── data/                    # Output JSON goes here
    ├── index.html               # Dashboard UI
```

---

## How to Run

1. **Clone Both Repositories**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/EduardoMV/SG2_Team3.git
git clone https://github.com/Fernandamenass/SG2_Tean3_MidTermII.git
```

2. **Run Simulation Script**:
```bash
cd SG2_Team3
python plotting.py
```
This generates a JSON file inside `SG2_Tean3_MidTermII/data`.

3. **Launch Dashboard**:
Open `index.html` from `SG2_Tean3_MidTermII` in any web browser (Live Server recommended).

---

## Technical Notes
- Built with **Python** (SimPy for simulation logic).
- Frontend: **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **D3.js**.
- Modular: JSON decouples the simulation from the UI.
- Data granularity: Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Quarterly, Yearly.

---

## Future Improvements
- Add CSV/Excel export functionality for summaries.
- Add toggles for accident frequency or rejection rate.
- Expand to multi-factory simulations or shift-based logic.
